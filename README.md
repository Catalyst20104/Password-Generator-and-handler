# Password Generator and Storage System

## Overview

This project is a secure password generator and storage system that creates passwords based on user preferences and securely stores them in a MySQL database. The generated passwords are encrypted using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm for added security.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Users can generate passwords with varying complexity:
  - **Simple**
  - **Medium**
  - **Hard**

- **Encryption**: The generated passwords are encrypted using the DES algorithm before storage.

- **Storage**: Encrypted passwords are securely stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- PostgreSQL database
- DES algorithm for encryption
